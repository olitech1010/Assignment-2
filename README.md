Translate the Creation account recorded in Genesis 1 in the Bible into an interactive visual code. Implement this code using the concepts of classes and abstract data types taught in class. Hint: Use data structures such as a List or Stack to keep the days for the events in their correct order. The code should output the corresponding verse and include visual elements such as emojis to represent the themes in the creation. The implementation should be in Java. Submit the algorithm, pseudocode and the Java implementation.
